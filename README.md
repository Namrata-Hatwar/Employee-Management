Employee Management System
Overview
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to streamline and manage employee-related processes within an organization. Leveraging Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), this system provides a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for handling employee data and operations.

Key Features
Employee CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
Search and Filter: Efficiently search and filter employee records based on various criteria.
Performance Tracking: Record and track employee performance reviews and feedback.
Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the application logic.
Hibernate: An ORM framework used to map Java classes to database tables and handle database interactions.
MySQL: The relational database used to store employee data (alternatively, any other SQL-based database can be used).
Maven: A build automation tool used to manage project dependencies and build processes.
Swing: For dependency injection and additional enterprise features (if integrated).
